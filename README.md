# Odoo-bug
I found  a Bug in Odoo when creating modules.
If i try to make one and change the variable name/descriptor/type it gives me an error BUT it WILL update the variable regardless of the error.
After that if you try to save it it says that you cannot due to using special characters that are not allowed.
PS: I have tried to get this error again and sometimes it happens, other times it just doesn't let you update the name/type/descriptor.
